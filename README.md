# Helm Demo

What is Helm? Simply put, Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes.

Helm lets you create, organize, and publish releases for Kubernetes objects, using a powerful templating framework that can dynamically generate Kubernetes manifests and apply them.

Think of Helm as a tool that can bundle multiple components of your release package, and allow you to deploy them together as one cohesive unit which can be versioned.
